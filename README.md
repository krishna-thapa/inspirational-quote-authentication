# play-silhouette-slick-postgres

Simple Play application written in Scala programming language for the Authentication purpose.

## Frameworks, libraries and tools

- [Silhouette](https://www.silhouette.rocks/)
- Functional Relational Mapping for Scala with [Slick](http://scala-slick.org/)
- Scala language server with rich IDE features using [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/)
- Code formatter for Scala with [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/)

## Purpose

This simple web-based app is meant to demo a simple play form based login that persists user identity to a relational database.
It is configured to use bcrypt, so it is (ostensibly) secure.
More will be added as the project goes bigger.
